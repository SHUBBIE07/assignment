 // Naming conventions are just a way of naming Javascript variables or character sequence that used for identifiers. in more details ------

// A JavaScript naming conventions introduction by example -- which gives you the common sense when it comes to naming variables, 
// functions,classes or components in JavaScript. No one is enforcing these naming convention rules, however, they are widely accepted
//  as a standard in the 15 community. JavaScript variables are case sensitive .

// example;

//  1) no special characters when naming a variable
var game.y = "My name"  // this is wrong


//  2) use camelCase or snake_case while naming or other cases like Pascal Case or kebab Case. But in JS camelCasing is the best to use in javascript

// for camelCasing
var firstName = "Shubbie";
// for snake_casing
var first_name = "Shubbie";


// 3) variable name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($) or an underscore (_):
var _first = "Shubbie";
var $first = "Shubbie";


// 4) You cannot use reserved key words to name varibables -- they are words that have special meaning in JavaScript
var new = "Shubbie";   // this wont work because it is a reserved word
